So how I want the code to work: 
when I launch workflow_launcher.py it launched web application that in the first page show the exising woflow and allows to start or stop it and then to manage it whihc gets us to worflow page on the worflow page there would be tow columns posted_Messafes and message_history and terminal window output whihc will show logs also I would like to add button that would allow so the retrained examples and inform with ability to modify it in chonoloigcal order. Note that tweets in message history are the ones that either passed filtering, dublicate, and was geneared as a tweet or it wa preveented from posting by either filters the way in the backend this infromation can be goined from the folder in each worflow in each tweetfolder that is now being generated in trade_duck_6.py there would be file created with mdoel decision exlanation and for each of the files that exist it would be highlighted as a label in the tweet card and it would be possible to fix that by moving tweete to retrained examples and optionaly providing additnal informaiton


In the root directory there is:
workflows/
  /workflow1/
    /tweet_history/
    /posted_tweets/
    config.json
    .env
     /logs
     /retraining
  /workflow2/
    /tweet_history/
    /posted_tweets/
    trade_ducky_6.py
    .env
     /logs
     /retraining

workflow_launcher.py 




Future plans:
Each message in posted_messages will be analyzed for the sentiment
